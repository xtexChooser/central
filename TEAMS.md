# Forgejo teams

A team is a group of people who work together on a specific area to further Forgejo.

Some of the teams are trusted with access to exclusive resources that require credentials. To participate in such a team someone can open a pull request to add their name and their membership will be decided by the Forgejo community (see the [decision making document](DECISION-MAKING.md) for more information).

## Accessibility

Purpose: Work on improving Forgejo accessibility.

Team members:

* https://codeberg.org/Ryuno-Ki [March 2023 Agreement](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/meta/issues/181)

## Devops

Purpose: The team cares of all the technical resources that Forgejo depends on (hardware, CI, static web site hosting, social media etc.). It helps all other teams to use those resources by installing, upgrading or migrating them when needed. If a resource becomes unavailable, it will help restore it in a functional state.

Accountability:

* Fix problems that prevent the resources that Forgejo depends on from running.
* Keep the [credentials to access the resources](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/forgejo/CONTRIBUTING/SECRETS.md) in a safe place and share them with the teams that need them.
