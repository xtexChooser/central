**TL; DR: I am migrating my account at @xtexchooser@neko.ci to [@xtex@fe.disroot.org](https://fe.disroot.org/@xtex). If you have once followed the old account, please follow the new one.**

So, after a long hesitation, I finally decided to do the migration.

## Why?

The primary motivation is that, neko.ci has been down for about a month. I found I can't live without the fediverse.

However, I have been tired with Misskey for a while.

Although the UI of Misskey does attract me a lot, but its backend code does not taste well.

It has many old issues. For example, the job queue often stops delivering outboxes ([#11000](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/issues/11000)).

## The hesitation

I waited for neko.ci to be up again for a long time, but it upset me.

The gravity that keeps me from the migration is primary that I don't want to lose my followers, notes, etc.

As the server does not go up, I can't send a `as:Move` activity to move my followers.

But finally, I can't bear living without the fediverse anymore, and decided to migrate.

The journey, from @xtexchooser@neko.ci to @xtex@fe.disroot.org.

## The end

I have been configuring my new account, [@xtex@fe.disroot.org](https://fe.disroot.org/@xtex), on disroot.org, which is selected to be my new home.

Goodbye, neko.ci. Hello world, fe.disroot.org.
