title: "The rename of my GitHub account"

Since many years ago, since my first meeting with smart phones and the Internet, I have been using the name "xtex".

It has no special meaning, except for it is a sequence of random typed letters and it looked perfect in my eyes.

But soon, I found that many websites require at least six characters for user names. Thus I chose another random word "Chooser" and appended to my user name.

For many years I had been using that name, that long name. Even though I can't bear its length, renaming my account is still a breaking change. It takes time to update all git remotes on my working machine.

Today, when I wake up, I searched my mind for things to do. I still have several projects to be done, but I wanna find a easier job. And I remembered my GitHub rename plan.

The rename is from "xtexChooser" to "xtexx", the old "xtexx" (my ACL organization) to "xtexxx". And another placeholder organization "xtexChooser" has been created to keep a redirect.

There are not many meaning things in this post, but I just want to write something here. Why not?

By the way, happy new year.
