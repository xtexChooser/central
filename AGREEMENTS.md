# Forgejo Organization Agreements

Agreements are ways of working, practices and methods that help us work
together effectively to make Forgejo amazing and achieve its goals.

These are the overall Forgejo Organization agreements; specific teams may have
their own agreements about how they work. See <TEAMS.md> for more info.

## Decision Making

- **Where to document agreements:** When a decision is made, and it includes an agreement about how we do things, the person who initiated the decision records the agreement as follows:
    - If it's within a specific team, it goes into that team's agreements file
    - If it's a change in the roles of team members, update `TEAMS.md`
    - If it's a conceptual agreement about our purpose and values, it goes into `MISSION.md`
    - Otherwise, it goes into *this* file, i.e. `AGREEMENTS.md`
