To get the source, clone `git@codeberg.org:xtex/xtex-os.git` with git.

### Prebuilt

The prebuilt binaries are built by [Codeberg CI](https://ci.codeberg.org/) and uploaded to [envs.sh](https://envs.sh).

To get the prebuilt binaries, you can access the [download API](https://xtex.p.projectsegfau.lt/xos-download.sh?source).

For example, the x86 ISO is at [here](https://xtex.p.projectsegfau.lt/xos-download.sh?x86-iso).

## Build

1. Create a file called `local.config.mk` in the source code. Then write the following content to it.

   ```makefile
   CONFIG_ARCH = x86
   ```

   To debug, you can also add `CONFIG_NO_KASLR = y` and `CONFIG_DEBUG = y`.
