# Projects related to Forgejo

The [forgejo-contrib organization](https://codeberg.org/forgejo-contrib) hosts Forgejo related projects. There is no commitment for long term maintenance in this organization. Some projects may be long abandonned, others may be unsuitable for production.

If someone is willing to commit to long term maintenance, a project may be moved to the [forgejo organization](https://codeberg.org/forgejo). Or it can go back to the forgejo-contrib organization when it is no longer maintained.

The process to create a new repository is light and informal. It can be as simple as finding someone with the right permissions in the Forgejo chatroom and explain to them:

* How does it relate to Forgejo (just a very short description, a sentence or two just to get an idea)
* What would you like to name the thing
* What is the https://codeberg.org/ user name of the repository admin

The admin of the new repository is then in control of its project and will assign roles to new projects members as they see fit.
