## üìë Notes

* Dachary: Decision making process documentatin
    * Feedback:
        * Decision-making guide seems useful, despite seeming too long in the past
        * Some people seem to have read this document, it's reflected in their participation in decisions
* Dachary: Status report on legitimizing the security team
    * Feedback for election process
        * Opened issues for security team candidates
        * Do we have people present themselves and then we do with the best we have? Or do we make a list of requirements?
        * Frame it as expectations rather than requirements
        * We have a challenge with commitment/trust/reliability because we're volunteers, not full-time employees
        * No duration for review/re-election
            * Loic: 1 year as a good default, but also do have flexibility, depends on people's comfort to commit
            * Tallship: Allow people to step down early if their circumstances change, and to pick a short duration that suits them
            * Loic: Important to set a maximum, can re-reply but it means nobody holds a role for too long without being re-approved
                * Loic proposes to set this maximum to 1 year
            * How to track the durations and re-elections:
                * Loic: Have people open an issue when their role is close to ending
                * fr33: Make it very clear (probably in TEAMS.md) when's the end of the role of each person holding a role
        * [ ] fr33: Before launch, all roles need to have a duration set, and a system for reminding to elect roles when the time comes
    * Loic: Aim to have more than one person per team/role, because bus factor, people can disappear
        * [ ] fr33: Codify that somewhere
    * Loic: For non-exclusive membership in a team (i.e. being just a team member without a special role in the team), have a set time where if the person has been inactive, we remove them from the team (and they can come back in the future), proposing 2 years
        * [ ] fr33: Codify that when designing the election process based on sociocracy

* [ ] fr33: Reach out and invite people to these meetings
* [ ] fr33: Learn from the Feb-21 conflict
