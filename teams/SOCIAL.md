When a Forgejo contributor has access to https://floss.social/@forgejo, they are accountable for:

* Getting an agreement to toot. If a toot is agreed upon by other Forgejo contributors it does not need to be signed and the agreement must be concluded in a public place
* Signing the toot that are not discussed before being published. If a toot is published by the Forgejo contributor without consultation with anyone, it must be signed with `~ @name` that links to the social account of the contributor
* Attaching an alt text to images for accessibility
