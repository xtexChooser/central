# MediaWiki Developers

Welcome to the MediaWiki community! Please see [How to become a MediaWiki
hacker](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/How_to_become_a_MediaWiki_hacker) for
general information on contributing to MediaWiki.

## Development environment

MediaWiki provides an extendable local development environment based on Docker Compose. This environment provides PHP,
Apache, Xdebug and a SQLite database.

**Do not use the development environment to serve a public website! Bad things would happen!**

More documentation, examples, and configuration recipes are available at [mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki-Docker][mw-docker].

Support is available on the [Libera IRC network][libera-home] in the [#mediawiki channel][libera-webchat], and on
Phabricator by creating tasks with the [MediaWiki-Docker][mw-docker-phab] tag.

## Quickstart

### 1. Requirements

You'll need to have Docker installed:

* [Docker Desktop][docker-install] for macOS or Windows.
* [Docker engine][docker-linux] for Linux.

[docker-install]: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
[docker-linux]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

**Linux users**:

* We recommend installing `docker-ce`, `docker-ce-cli`, `containerd.io`, and `docker-compose-plugin` by [downloading the server
  releases][dc-release] for your distribution rather than Docker Desktop. You can also install the [binaries][dc-binaries].
* Follow the instructions to ["Manage Docker as a non-root user"][dc-non-root]

[dc-release]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
[dc-binaries]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/
[dc-non-root]: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user

**Windows users**:

Running Docker from a Windows terminal and using the Windows file system will result in MediaWiki being very slow. For Windows 10 and higher, we recommend configuring Docker and Windows to use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux). Turn on WSL in your Windows settings, then run the following commands: `wsl --install -d ubuntu` and `wsl --set-version ubuntu 2`. Then go into Docker -> Settings -> General -> tick "Use the WSL 2 based engine", then go into Docker -> Settings -> Resources -> WSL Integration -> tick "Ubuntu". `git clone` the mediawiki repository into a WSL folder such as `home/yourusername/mediawiki` so that the files are inside WSL. Then you can run most of the commands in this tutorial outside of WSL, by opening PowerShell, navigating to the WSL directory with `cd \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\yourusername\mediawiki`, and executing shell commands as normal. To access WSL from PowerShell (rare but may be needed sometimes), you can use the command `ubuntu` to turn a PowerShell console into a WSL console. To navigate to WSL folders in [File Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Explorer), show the Navigation Pane, then towards the bottom, look for "Linux" (it will be close to "This PC").

**Mac users**:

If you're using Docker Desktop and have the `Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon` setting enabled, you may encounter an issue where loading the wiki results in a blank page or a 503 error. To resolve this, disable the setting and restart Docker Desktop. See [this page](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/P49617) for more information.

### 2. Download MediaWiki files

Download the latest MediaWiki files to your computer. One way to download the latest alpha version of MediaWiki is to
[install git](https://git-scm.com/), open a shell, navigate to the directory where you want to save the files, then type
`git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/mediawiki/core.git mediawiki`.

Optional: If you plan to submit patches to this repository, you will probably want to [create a Gerrit account](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Create_a_Wikimedia_developer_account),
then type `git remote set-url origin ssh://YOUR-GERRIT-USERNAME-HERE@gerrit.wikimedia.org:29418/mediawiki/core`,
replacing YOUR-GERRIT-USERNAME-HERE with your Gerrit username. Please see the official
[MediaWiki Gerrit tutorial](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/Tutorial) for more information.

### 3. Prepare `.env` file

Using a text editor, create a `.env` file in the root of the MediaWiki core repository, and copy these contents into
that file:

```sh
MW_SCRIPT_PATH=/w
MW_SERVER=http://localhost:8080
MW_DOCKER_PORT=8080
MEDIAWIKI_USER=Admin
MEDIAWIKI_PASSWORD=dockerpass
XDEBUG_CONFIG=
XDEBUG_ENABLE=true
XHPROF_ENABLE=true
```

Windows users: Run the following command to add a blank user ID and group ID to your `.env` file:

```sh
echo "
MW_DOCKER_UID=
MW_DOCKER_GID=" >> .env
```

Non-Windows users: Run the following command to add your user ID and group ID to your `.env` file:

```sh
echo "MW_DOCKER_UID=$(id -u)
MW_DOCKER_GID=$(id -g)" >> .env
```

Linux users: If you'd like to use Xdebug features inside your IDE, then create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file as
well:

```yaml
services:
  mediawiki:
    # For Linux: This extra_hosts section enables Xdebug-IDE communication:
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

### 4. Create the environment

* Start the containers:
  ```sh
  docker compose up -d
  ```
  The "up" command makes sure that the PHP and webserver containers are running (and any others in the
  `docker-compose.yml` file). It is safe to run at any time, and will do nothing if the containers are already running.

  The first time, it may take a few minutes to download new Docker images.

  The `-d` argument stands for "detached" mode, which run the services in the background. If you suspect a problem with
  one of the services, you can run it without `-d` to follow the server logs directly from your terminal. You don't have
  to stop the services first, if you ran it with `-d` and then without, you'll get connected to the already running
  containers including a decent back scroll of server logs.

  Note that MediaWiki debug logs go to `/cache/*.log` files (not sent to docker).

* Install PHP dependencies from Composer:
  ```sh
  docker compose exec mediawiki composer update
  ```

* Install MediaWiki:
  ```sh
  docker compose exec mediawiki /bin/bash /docker/install.sh
  ```
  Windows users: make sure you run the above command in PowerShell as it does not work in Bash.

* Windows users: Make sure to set the SQLite directory to be writable.
  ```sh
  docker compose exec mediawiki chmod -R o+rwx cache/sqlite
  ```

Done! The wiki should now be available for you at <http://localhost:8080>.

## Usage

### Running commands

You can use `docker compose exec mediawiki bash` to open a Bash shell in the
MediaWiki container. You can then run one or more commands as needed and stay
within the container shell.

You can also run a single command in the container directly from your host
shell, for example: `docker compose exec mediawiki php maintenance/run.php update`.

### PHPUnit

Run a single PHPUnit file or directory:

```sh
docker compose exec mediawiki bash
instance:/w$ cd tests/phpunit
instance:/w/tests/phpunit$ composer phpunit -- path/to/my/test/
```

See [PHPUnit on mediawiki.org][phpunit-testing] for more examples.

[phpunit-testing]: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:PHP_unit_testing/Running_the_tests

### Selenium

You can use [Fresh][fresh] to run [Selenium in a dedicated
container][selenium-dedicated]. Example usage:

```sh
fresh-node -env -net
npm ci
npm run selenium-test
```

[selenium-dedicated]: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Selenium/Getting_Started/Run_tests_using_Fresh

### API Testing

You can use [Fresh][fresh] to run [API tests in a dedicated
container][api-dedicated]. Example usage:

```sh
export MW_SERVER=http://localhost:8080/
export MW_SCRIPT_PATH=/w
export MEDIAWIKI_USER=Admin
export MEDIAWIKI_PASSWORD=dockerpass
fresh-node -env -net
# Create .api-testing.config.json as documented on
# https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_API_integration_tests
npm ci
npm run api-testing
```

[fresh]: https://github.com/wikimedia/fresh
[api-dedicated]: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_API_integration_tests

## Modify the development environment

You can override the default services from a `docker-compose.override.yml`
file, and make use of those overrides by changing `LocalSettings.php`.

Example overrides and configurations can be found under
[MediaWiki-Docker on mediawiki.org][mw-docker].

After updating `docker-compose.override.yml`, run `docker compose down`
followed by `docker compose up -d` for changes to take effect.

### Install extra packages

If you need root on the container to install system packages with `apt-get` for
troubleshooting, you can open a shell as root with
`docker compose exec --user root mediawiki bash`.

### Install extensions and skins

To install an extension or skin, follow the instructions of the mediawiki.org
page for the extension or skin in question, and look for any dependencies
or additional steps that may be needed.

For most extensions, only two steps are needed: download the code to the
right directory, and then enable the component from `LocalSettings.php`.

To install the Vector skin:

1. Clone the skin:
    ```sh
    cd skins/
    git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/mediawiki/skins/Vector
    ```

2. Enable the skin, by adding the following to `LocalSettings.php`:
    ```php
    wfLoadSkin( 'Vector' );
    ```

To install the EventLogging extension:

1. Clone the extension repository:

    ```sh
    cd extensions/
    git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/mediawiki/extensions/EventLogging
    ```

    Alternatively, if you have extension repositories elsewhere on disk, mount each one as an overlapping volume in
    `docker-compose.override.yml`. This is comparable to a symlink, but those are not well-supported in Docker.

    ```yaml
   services:
     mediawiki:
       volumes:
         - ~/Code/EventLogging:/var/www/html/w/extensions/EventLogging:cached
    ```

2. Enable the extension, by adding the following to `LocalSettings.php`:
    ```php
    wfLoadExtension( 'EventLogging' );
    ```

### Xdebug

By default, you will need to set `XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1` in the GET/POST, or as an
environment variable, to turn on Xdebug for a request.

You can also install a browser extension for controlling whether Xdebug is
active. See the [official Xdebug Step Debugging][step-debug], particularly the
"Activating Step Debugging" section, for more details.

[step-debug]: https://xdebug.org/docs/step_debug

If you wish to run Xdebug on every request, you can set
`start_with_request=yes` in `XDEBUG_CONFIG` in your .env file:

```
XDEBUG_CONFIG=start_with_request=yes
```

You can pass any of Xdebug's configuration values in this variable. For example:

```
XDEBUG_CONFIG=client_host=192.168.42.34 client_port=9000 log=/tmp/xdebug.log
```

This shouldn't be necessary for basic use cases, but see [the Xdebug settings
documentation](https://xdebug.org/docs/all_settings) for available settings.

### Codex

You can use your local version of Codex instead of the one bundled with MediaWiki. This is useful
when testing how changes in Codex affect Codex-based features in MediaWiki.

1. Clone the Codex repository and build Codex, if you haven't done this already:
    ```sh
    cd ../
    git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/design/codex
    cd codex
    npm run build-all
    ```
2. If your clone of the Codex repository is outside of the MediaWiki directory (this is common),
   add the following to your `docker-compose.override.yml`. Replace `~/git/codex` with the path to
   your Codex clone.

    ```yaml
   services:
     mediawiki:
       volumes:
         - ~/git/codex:/var/www/html/w/codex:cached
    ```
3. To apply the change to `docker-compose.override.yml`, you have to recreate the environment:
    ```sh
    docker compose down
    docker compose up -d
    ```
4. Enable Codex development mode by adding the following to the bottom of `LocalSettings.php`:

    ```php
    $wgCodexDevelopmentDir = MW_INSTALL_PATH . '/codex';
    ```

   To disable Codex development mode and use the regular version of Codex, delete or comment out
   this line.
5. Every time you make a change to your local copy of Codex (or download a Gerrit change), you
   have to rerun Codex's build process for these changes to take effect. To do this, run
   `npm run build-all` in the Codex directory.

### Stop or recreate environment

Stop the environment, perhaps to reduce the load when working on something
else. This preserves the containers, to be restarted later quickly with
the `docker compose up -d` command.

```sh
docker compose stop
```

Destroy and re-create the environment. This will delete the containers,
including any logs, caches, and other modifications you may have made
via the shell.

```sh
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### Re-install the database

To empty the wiki database and re-install it:

* Remove or rename the `LocalSettings.php` file.
* Delete the `cache/sqlite` directory.
* Re-run the "Install MediaWiki database" command.

You can now restore or copy over any modifications you had in your previous `LocalSettings.php` file.
And if you have any additional extensions installed that required a database table, then also run:
`docker compose exec mediawiki php maintenance/run.php update`.

## Troubleshooting

### Caching

If you suspect a change is not applying due to caching, start by [hard
refreshing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache) the browser.

If that doesn't work, you can narrow it down by disabling various server-side
caching layers in `LocalSettings.php`, as follows:

```php
$wgMainCacheType = CACHE_NONE;
$wgMessageCacheType = CACHE_NONE;
$wgParserCacheType = CACHE_NONE;
$wgResourceLoaderMaxage = [
  'versioned' => 0,
  'unversioned' => 0
];
```

The default settings of MediaWiki are such that caching is smart and changes
propagate immediately. Using the above settings may slow down your wiki
significantly. Especially on macOS and Windows, where Docker Desktop uses
a VM internally and thus has longer file access times.

See [Manual:Caching][manual-caching] on mediawiki.org for more information.

[manual-caching]: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Caching

### Xdebug ports

Older versions of Xdebug used port 9000, which could conflict with php-fpm
running on the host. This document used to recommend a workaround of telling
your IDE to listen on a different port (e.g., 9009) and setting
`XDEBUG_CONFIG=remote_port=9009` in your `.env`.

Xdebug 3.x now uses the `client_port` value, which defaults to 9003. This
should no longer conflict with local php-fpm installations, but you may need
to change the settings in your IDE or debugger.

### Linux desktop, host not found

The image uses `host.docker.internal` as the `client_host` value which
should allow Xdebug work for Docker for Mac/Windows.

On Linux, you need to create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file with the following
contents:

```yaml
services:
  mediawiki:
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

With the latest version of Docker on Linux hosts, this _should_ work
transparently as long as you're using the recommended
`docker-compose.override.yml`. If it doesn't, first check `docker version` to
make sure you're running Docker 20.10.2 or above, and `docker compose version`
to make sure it's 1.27.4 or above.

If Xdebug still doesn't work, try specifying the hostname or IP address of your
host. The IP address works more reliably. You can obtain it by running e.g.
`ip -4 addr show docker0` and copying the IP address into the config in `.env`,
like `XDEBUG_CONFIG=remote_host=172.17.0.1`

### Generating logs

Switching on the remote log for Xdebug comes at a performance cost so only
use it while troubleshooting. You can enable it like so: `XDEBUG_CONFIG=remote_log=/tmp/xdebug.log`

### "(Permission Denied)" errors on running docker compose

See if you're able to run any docker commands to start with. Try running
`docker container ls`, which should also throw a permission error. If not,
go through the following steps to get access to the socket that the docker
client uses to talk to the daemon.

`sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

And then `relogin` (or `newgrp docker`) to re-login with the new group membership.

### "(Cannot access the database: Unknown error (localhost))"

The environment's working directory has recently changed to `/var/www/html/w`.
Reconfigure this in your `LocalSettings.php` by ensuring that the following
values are set correctly:

```php
$wgScriptPath = '/w';
$wgSQLiteDataDir = "/var/www/html/w/cache/sqlite";
```

### Windows users, "(Cannot access the database: No database connection (unknown))"

The permissions with the `cache/sqlite` directory have to be set manually on Windows:

```sh
docker compose exec mediawiki chmod -R o+rwx cache/sqlite
```

### Linux users, "(Cannot access the database: No database connection (localhost))"

Make sure you have the `MW_DOCKER_UID` and `MW_DOCKER_GID` set in your `.env` file (instructions above).
