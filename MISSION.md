**STATUS**: This file is a co-working **draft**. When we officially launch the
governance system, it will be **explicitly approved** by everyone in the
Organization, and go through a round of **community feedback** in order to
create and maintain consent, trust and togetherness.

# Vision

Vision is a deep, fundamental orientation, direction and meaning, a source of
inspirational energy to act, that guides our work. Hints for deriving our
vision:

- What is the world we are striving for?
- If there was a magic wand and everything was possible, what would we most
  deeply want for ourselves, for those we love, for the community, for society,
  for the world?
- Be receptive, be open to our intuition, follow our curiosity

From our vision, we derive our *purpose* and *values*.

# Purpose

Purpose is the piece of the vision that is ours to do; that is an expression of
our innate gifts and is within our capacity to take on. Purpose is the "action"
part of moving towards the vision, a verb. Hints for deriving our purpose:

- What piece of the vision are we called to take on?
- Why do we do what we do?
- What ignites our heart and is within our capacity?
- Whom are we serving?

From our purpose, we derive our *mission*(s).

# Mission

Mission is the overall kinds of action taken to bridge the gap between the
current reality and the vision; anchoring our purpose into action and tangibly
moving us towards vision. Mission is what's within our capacity to do that
moves us towards the purpose. Hints for deriving our mission:

- What are the concrete things we do that actively mobilize towards our purpose?
- Given our strengths, limitations, resources and situation, where does it make
  sense to focus energy in terms of what will be a step in the direction of
  realizing the purpose?
- Finding the highest level of action that realizes purpose and acts as an
  umbrella to organize the finer elements

From our mission(s), we derive our
[roadmap](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/meta/issues/10).

# Values

Values are qualities of our vision for Forgejo, which allow us to anchor the
vision into reality by practicing them within our work on Forgejo. From these
values we can derive specific practical agreements.

Please gather the Forgejo team's approval, and discuss as needed, before
adding or editing values. See [`DECISION-MAKING.md`](DECISION-MAKING.md) for
