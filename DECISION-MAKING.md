# Decision-making in Forgejo

**who** makes a decision: See decision-making table in <AGREEMENTS.md>

**How** to make a decision in a group: See guide below.

## Quick Guide for making a decision

This is a **guide** to help us make decisions, a useful resource when we're stuck or unsure.

These are just guidelines, not rules. If you know how to get started with the decision you want to make, please go ahead! But if you're unsure, or stuck, or just curious, this guide is for you.

### (a) Principles

Concept:

- **Willingness**: Instead of voting on the option you *prefer* (which leads to polarization and confusion, and makes it impossible to find consensus), you raise your hand/thumb on the options you're *comfortable with and willing to accept* (which supports us in identifying concerns, handling them, and picking proposals that really take us towards our goals and that we all agree on)
- **Concerns**:
    - When people are against a proposal, try to guess and look for *what's important to them*, which need/concern/value they're defending
    - So the key question is **What's important to you?**, it often helps to finish arguments and move forward together
- **Proposals**:
    - We seek to make a decision that is:
        - Good enough for now, safe enough to try (i.e. it doesn't need to be perfect)
        - Moving us towards our shared goal
    - So we think of concerns and oppositions as gifts expressing a potential reason that the current proposal:
        - Isn't good enough for the current circumstances
        - Isn't safe enough to try
        - Hinders or endangers our progress towards the shared goal
- **Cooperation**: Working with willingness and concerns allows us to work together as a team, to make good decisions about Forgejo, rather than competing for our voice to be heard and for our personal proposals to be picked
- **Capacity and clarity**: We aim to make clear actionable practical agreements we're really capable of following. If we repeatedly struggle/fail to follow them, it's often a sign they're beyond our current capacity, and then we identify the difficulty and modify the agreements to be fully within what we're currently capable of.

Technical:

- If using issues/PRs/Matrix becomes difficult for an important decision, there's an option to do a real-time text-audio-video meeting

Challenges:

- Strong disagreement = very important concerns being present! Try to find them
- Conflict = opportunity to connect, grow and learn! Try to breathe and go slowly
- Stuck in a challenging situation, conflict, disagreement? *Ask for help*

### (b) The general basic method

- Propose your idea
- Ask for the relevant (or whole) team's approval, making sure everyone who may care or be impacted by this decision is invited and included
- If someone disapproves, try to hear **what's important to them** about the decision
- Together, modify the proposal to address their concerns
- Ask for team's approval on modified proposal
- Document the decision

### (c) More complicated decisions

1. Communicate the decision to the relevant (or whole) team (using e.g. issue tracker, matrix, etc.); see [`TEAMS.md`](TEAMS.md)
2. If the expected proposals on this decision are expected to be big, e.g. a plan for a whole system, consider to start by gathering criteria, i.e. which qualities the chosen proposal will need to have
3. Invite people to make suggestions, perhaps ping people who have related knowledge/expertise to make sure they participate
4. Wait a few days for people make proposals
5. Ask people to make a +1 on each decision they're **willing to live with, comfortable with**
6. Wait (recommended: **2 weeks**) to give people time to do that, ping people you believe may be impacted by the decision to make sure they have a chance to participate
7. Pick the option that has the least opposition, ask the people who aren't willing to live with it:
    - What's your concern about this proposal, what's important to you that prevents you from feeling comfortable with this proposal?
    - What can support you (to be done or changed) to feel comfortable with this proposal?
8. Change the proposal if needed, based on the feedback
9. Ask everyone to +1 if they're willing to live with the modified proposal
10. Once there's consensus,
    - Document the decision in AGREEMENTS.md
    - Document any followup tasks and who's going to do them and when
    - Eventually close the issue
