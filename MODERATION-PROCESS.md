The moderation team is responsible for putting an end to behaviors going against the Code of Conduct or the law.

## Moderation team members

People who would like to become members of the moderation team apply by posting an application in the [governance tracker](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/governance). If there is an agreement according to the decision making process, they become part of the moderation team for a period of one year.

Members of the moderation team are expected to recuse themselves from decision-making in any potential moderation action in which they could be seen to have a conflict of interest, so long as other team members remain available to act.

## Moderation contact

The moderation team can be contacted at any time by sending a mail to moderation@forgejo.org. These discussions are private and will only be disclosed in accordance with the moderation process.

## Moderation process (mandatory)

The moderation team acts when they think it is necessary and must always:

* Enforce moderation using a shared, non personal account dedicated to that purpose.
  * forgejo-moderation for codeberg.org
  * https://matrix.to/#/#forgejo-moderation:matrix.org for Matrix spaces
* Document the action in the [governance tracker](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/governance/issues) without including any element that would allow to directly identify the target of the moderation or the people involved.
* Document the action in the [moderation](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/moderation) repository including all the details necessary for other Forgejo members to review its relevance, that is including all the facts and the reasoning that concludes the behavior goes against the Code of Conduct or the law.
* Answer questions from Forgejo members to clarify the situation.
* Remove the explanation of the action one year after its publication to respect the right to be forgotten of the people targeted by the moderation action.
* If someone who participates in the Forgejo community on a regular basis asks the action is amended, this request must be acted up by a moderation team member without undue delay.

It is unnecessary to follow that process when the accounts targeted by the moderation action are obviously robots or if their first and only interaction in a Forgejo space goes against the Code of Conduct.

## Moderation guide (optional)

It is suggested that moderation actions follow the following principles. Their application is at the discretion of the moderation team, depending on the circumstances. The detailed explanation of the moderation action and the discussions that follow are an opportunity for each member of the Forgejo community to ask the moderation team to justify why they deviated from this guide.

* A person is excluded from Forgejo spaces after having been warned several times that his or her behavior is contrary to the Code of Conduct or the law.
* A person is excluded from Forgejo spaces after behaving in a way contrary to the Code of Conduct or the law and declaring without any doubt her or his intention to repeat these behaviors.
* When a person is removed from Forgejo spaces, their account is anonymized and the detailed explanation refers to their anonymized account, not their account before anonymization.
* A member of the moderation team acts in consultation with other team members and not unilaterally.
* The duration of a person's exclusion is at least three months and must be as short as possible. It is assessed by evaluating the amount of work required for an exclusion and the likelihood that it will be repeated when the person is reintegrated into the Forgejo spaces.
* If the excluded person asks the moderation team (by writing to moderation@forgejo.org) to be reinstated early, this request is added to the issue about the exclusion decision in the [moderation](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/moderation) repository. The moderation team responds to the request and provides reasons for its response.
